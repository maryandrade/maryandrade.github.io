As the end of the holidays is approaching (in Spain that's on January 6th), I just want to get back to the rhythm of work I was having before the kids finished school. This means waking up at 5:00 am to take advantage of the quiet hours to write and get a head start on the day.

This two weeks off made me think and reframe the scope of the work I want to produce. I find that I get the most enjoyment out of UI design, so that's where I want to focus my efforts and build a strong portfolio around it. [Sean McCabe][seanwes] is a proponent on curating the work and the content you share because your audience is going to associate you with just one thing, not two or three, and that one thing should be what you want to be known for. Although I have many interests, I want my portfolio to focus only on UI design and some front-end development to achieve interaction and manipulation.

So I will continue to work on my [Unicorn challenge]({% post_url 2015-11-09-unicorn-challenge %}) as I was doing before the holidays started. I have an ignited disposition to continue my practice in UI design, and I also have other creative projects I want to complete before the end of the year. As I said in my previous post, 2016 is going to be the year where I want to focus my efforts in producing work and taking action on my creative ideas, and the development of a side project that just can't leave my mind even when I'm going to bed at night.

As Elizabeth Gilbert puts it:
