I don’t have a photograph with my father.

He is the kind of father that thought nothing was more important in this world than his children. He gave everything he could to us. I idolized him when I was a little girl, like most girls do with their father. I’ve never felt more loved by anyone. I know the magnitude of this feeling because I’m a mother now and I know what it means to love your own children.

Once the super hero to me, my dad is more fragile than ever and I can’t be with him to let him know that I appreciate everything he did for me and all the love that he made sure I received. His memories are slipping away and I can’t be there to make him remember.

What hurts the most is he’s not able to play with his grandchildren. Maybe if he did he would be a happier grandpa.

When he is gone I won’t have an image of just the two of us being happy. An image that would remind me of how much he loved me and how much I loved him. Of our time together on this earth.

He used to have a temper, and I hated him for it, but later, his love for me was so grandiose that I never doubted how pure his love for me was. I was one of the lucky humans to have a father like him.
