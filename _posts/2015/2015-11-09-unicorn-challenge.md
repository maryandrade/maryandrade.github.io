As any professional knows, the development of any skill requires time and commitment. A commitment to better yourself with intentionality. After consuming a lot of information about this topic, I decided to change things up and make a serious commitment to better my skills in design and front-end development (or become what is known as an unicorn in the design industry). There are too many available resources on the web, and all the creators I follow arrive at the same conclusion: you need to put yourself out there, you have to become a publisher of your own work and let your progression be your motivation to continue to do [your best creative work][shawn].

Ideas don't work without execution, and I want to execute more and think less. This thought process started very simply by asking myself the most basic question: What do I want to do... for myself? The answer came very clearly: I want to be better at my craft.

I became very fond of YouTube, this is where you can find most creators these days. During one of my "surfing" days I discovered a designer/developer/youtuber named [Mackenzie Child][mackenzie]. This guy did the impressive thing to build 12 web apps in 12 weeks to teach himself Ruby on Rails. More recently, he started a new challenge about designing 100 UI elements in 100 days. Talk about unbelievable. Of course, such a feat is inspiring at any level, and this pushed me in the direction of thinking in setting my own challenge to better myself.

I have a background in design as well, but haven't practiced my craft rigorously for the past 6 years since I pursued other career paths. In this season of my life, I'm at a point where I want to go back to do what I like the most.

By taking Mackenzie's idea, I'm presenting what I have called my "Unicorn challenge". I'm committed to complete 5 web design projects, and 20 UI design projects in 3 months, starting on November 1st and ending on January 31st, and publish the results on this website and social media.

This is the list of the projects I want to do:

### Web design projects:

1. One page website for a service provider professional.
2. One page website about an app (skills: SVG, some JavaScript)
3. Music player with a playlist of songs (skills: JavaScript)
4. Interactive haikus (skills: CSS3 animations, SVG, JavaScript, JQuery)
5. Design and build a Jekyll site from scratch (this one is quite scary).

### UI design elements:

1. To-do list web app
2. Music player
3. Weather Mac widget
4. Calorie counter app
5. My personal branding
6. More ideas to come...

I'm pretty sure it won't be easy, and often times I will feel frustrated when things are not giving the results I want, but I want to do this, and the best time to start anything new, is now.
