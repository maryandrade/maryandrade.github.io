## What I'm focused and working on right now:

In the spirit of sharing, I'm taking the fine idea of the Now page by [Derek Silvers][original-now].

These are some of the things I'm actively pursuing now that take my full attention:

### Work:

- Working on my [Unicorn challenge]({% post_url /2015/2015-11-09-unicorn-challenge %}) of developing 5 front-end development projects, and 20 UI designs in 3 months.
- Writing 1 blog post per week in this website to develop my writing skills.
- Designing my other website [Storied Living][project]

### Personal:

- Doing a routine of meditation and gratitude every morning for all the blessings my family has.
- Trying to develop the routine of waking up at 5:00 am to start working before my kids wake up at 7:45 am.
- Spending weekends with my family, teaching my 5 year old girl to read, and going out to get to know the city of Madrid.
- Exercising in group every Saturday morning at [Juan Carlos I Park][park].

### Reading:

- Some fiction before going to sleep: enjoying ["Station Eleven"][book] by Emily St. John Mendel in hardcover edition.
