![Mary](/images/me.png)

My name is Mary Andrade, and I'm a web designer in constant learning and refinement. I was born in Caracas, Venezuela and moved to Portugal in 2009 with my husband to earn my Masters degree in multimedia technologies. In 2015, due to work opportunities, we moved our family to Madrid, Spain where we're feeling quite at home and happy with our two children.

My main interest is web design and I have a fascination with front-end web technologies. In this site I present the evolution of my work, the exploration of my own creativity through writing, and an outlet to connect with like minded individuals who I can share my interests in culture, books, and good intentions.

Please visit my [Now page]({{ site.baseurl }}/now/ ) if you're interested in knowing how I occupy my time and attention.  

About this Site

For those who care about technology, this site is built and published using the static site generator [Jekyll][jekyll]. I did this to hone my skills in front-end technologies. Every article is written in [Markdown][markdown], and the hosting is taken care of by [Github][github].
