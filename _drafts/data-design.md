This summary is taken from the ebook ["Data + Design. A simple introduction to preparing and visualizing information"][ebook] written with a Creative Commons license by Trina Chiasson, Dyanna Gregory, et. al. I'm researching on the topic of the design aspect of data visualization and this ebook served as a good introduction, so in this post I'm highlighting a few considerations to take into account in the preparation of a data visualization.

The visualization of data, or the presentation of data, follows a procedure of communication, wherein the first step is to determine the message the data is trying to communicate. This key message should be explained in a few sentences and before the process of visualization starts, this message must be determined and serve as the reference to the data visualization process.

The next step, is to determine the audience. This will help in understanding which and how much data to illustrate. When deciding which data to illustrate, the process should start by taking the key message and elaborate on it into a story, where a set of facts should be presented that will gradually lead the audience into the key message.

>The data you choose to illustrate should set the context, establish the main points of interest, and explain how these are interconnected. Your visual story should be based on what the data-and not only what you want to-say.

If visualizing data is going to make the content more digestible to audiences, then it is important not to present more than what the audience expects, or more information than what the audience needs to understand the message.
